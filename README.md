Super Bunny Buster II Turbo Bounce - Carrot Edition is a score-attack game for Android tablets and smartphones in which a bunny bounces high and scores points by bursting things!

The bunny bursts things by ramming into them at high speed.
Yep.

Controls: 
* Tapping the screen with a single finger makes the character walk towards the touched area. 
* Tapping the screen with a second finger makes the character jump if they are on the ground.
* Tapping the screen with a second finger makes the character rocket towards the nearest target an in attempt to burst it. (If the character tries and can't reach after 4 seconds, the character will stop and drop to the ground, exhausted.)


There's a few different modes, but the default is a timed score attack: Burst as much as you can in 2 minutes.
